</B></FONT><P></A>Your writing determines</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>whether people read what you have to say,</P>
<P>whether they understand it,</P>
<P>whether they agree with it, and</P>
<P>whether they remember it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>You have to pursue each of these goals somewhat independently: If you ignore any of these goals, your publications will fall short of their potential impacts by attracting fewer readers than they could, by conveying less information than they could, by persuading or motivating fewer readers than they could, or by drawing fewer citations than they could.</P>
<H2>Just get it onto paper.</H2>
<P>Worry about big issues of what to say and when to say it, not details of precisely how to say it.</P>
<H2>Start with a seductive introduction.</H2><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Tell a story.</P>
<P>Defend an implausible statement.</P>
<P>Contradict an authority.</P>
<P>Contradict common sense.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>For example, Daft and Weick began their article on "Organizations as interpretation systems" (AMR, 1984) by saying "Consider the game of 20 questions. Normally in this game one person. . . . Organizations play 20 questions."</P>
<H2>End with a memorable conclusion.</H2>
<P>Do not point out that this manuscript does not answer all questions or that more research is needed. These are clich&eacute;s.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Point out a few practical implications.</P>
<P>Tell a story.</P>
<P>Spring a surprise.</P>
<P>Give your findings an ironic twist.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<H2>Put the main ideas into the introduction and conclusion.</H2>
<P>Readers are most likely to remember the last thing they read; they are next most likely to remember the first thing they read; they are least likely to remember material that was in the middle. Therefore, you should put the most important information at the end of a manuscript and at its beginning.</P>
<P>An introduction should</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>persuade readers that they want to read the whole manuscript</P>
<P>convince readers that you are a credible source of information</P>
<P>give readers a map of the manuscript - what is to come.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A conclusion should</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>summarize the manuscript's main arguments and conclusions</P>
<P>make readers feel happy that they read the manuscript</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>You cannot make readers feel satisfied by discussing the deficiencies of your study. Discuss deficiencies and the need for further studies earlier, perhaps where you describe your methodology, perhaps where you analyze your findings.</P>
<P>Thus, together, an introduction and conclusion should provide a rather complete document - one that motivates readers, orients them, and provides them with the most important information.</P>
<H2>Maintain a logical flow (AB --&gt; BC --&gt; CD)</H2><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>from sentence to sentence, </P>
<P>from paragraph to paragraph, and </P>
<P>from section to section.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A finished document should flow linearly from the first words in the first sentence to the final words in the final sentence. Readers should understand the first sentence without reading any other part of the document. They should understand the second sentence without reading anything except the first sentence, and the second sentence should continue the first sentence logically and, often, grammatically. Readers should understand the third sentence after reading only the first two sentences, and the third sentence should follow the second sentence logically and grammatically.</P>
<H2>Tell readers the structure.</H2><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Outline the document at the end of the introduction.</P>
<P>Put reminders at the ends of sections.</P>
<P>Put topic sentences at the beginnings of sections.</P>
<P>Put topic sentences at the beginnings of paragraphs.</P>
<P>Put the main points at the beginnings or ends of paragraphs.</P>
<P>Summarize the whole document near the end. Restate the key points.</P></DIR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Then">THEN, COPYEDIT WHAT YOU WROTE</P>
</B></FONT><P></A>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>After you have it on paper, copyedit it.</H2>
<P>Writing a manuscript constitutes no more than a beginning, and it should take perhaps half of the writing time. Copyediting should take the other half.</P>
<P>Copyediting can instigate revolutions. When you examine your ideas in microscopic detail, you may discover that basic concepts need drastic revisions. And nitpicking through your words may show you that paragraphs or sections ought to follow different sequences.</P><DIR>

<U><P>Inferences about changes</U>: Cross-sectional data provide no basis for talking about changes over time. To fabricate a longitudinal theory from cross-sectional data is specious science, and cross-sectional theories can be interesting in their own right. Yet authors of cross-sectional studies drew the following inferences:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Size is a good predictor of</P>
<P>Changes in size lead to changes in</P>
<P>As an organization becomes larger through more personnel, its structural complexity becomes larger.</P>
<P>as organizations become larger, (1) structuring of activities increases and (2) managerial decision making becomes more decentralized and autonomous. Organizational efficiency increases with these personnel additions.</P>
<P>If the number of departments and branches increase[s], efficiency declines.</P>
<P>The increases in size cause new jobs, departments, branches and levels. </P>
<P>as state control increases, so does the likelihood of</P>
<P>as the number of specialized functional areas increases, more documentation of rules and procedures is required</P>
<P>Over time, we find female salaries lose additional ground. </P>
<P>while signaling does lead to loose coupling</P>
<P>Rate of development in organizational structure as company size increased was related to</P>
<P>Those who attended the elite schools experience greater rewards as years pass.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If you have time-series data from which to draw inferences about changes, then use statistical techniques that are appropriate to time series. If you have only cross-sectional data, then draw inferences appropriate to such data - compare larger organizations with smaller ones, or compare older people with younger ones, or compare newspapers with pharmaceutical firms.</P>
<U><P>Causal</U> <U>inferences</U>: Although one might try to gather data about causality - such as time-series data at very close intervals - virtually no research does this. Thus, one should rarely draw causal inferences from data, and never draw causal inferences from cross-sectional data. However, authors of cross-sectional studies made the following statements.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Organizational size seemed to have a negative effect on the salaries. </P>
<P>nor was there significant effect of</P>
<P>Years since the degree, being older, having longer tenure, working in smaller firms, and being located in an urban area positively influenced wage attainments.</P>
<P>Size has a more pervasive effect on administrative control processes in U.S. organizations.</P>
<P>The results reveal significant direct effects for technology on dimensions of organizational control.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<U><P>Inferences</U> <U>about</U> <U>rationales</U>: If you want to study rationales, ask people about them. Do not infer people's rationales from the consequences of their actions. For example, do not interpret correlations between salaries and employees' characteristics as disclosing rationales used by salary administrators; salaries result from interactions between numerous salary administrators and numerous actual and potential employees, each of whom may have a different rationale.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>we will attempt to explore the rationale for the use [by subjects] of variables such as X and Y in decision making about Z</P>
<P>By examining these characteristics under varying conditions, we hope to illuminate better their roles in [other people's] decisions.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<U><P>Perceptions</U>: When describing perceptual data, frequently insert words such as perceive, believe, think, and say. Do not misrepresent perceptual data - such as questionnaire responses - as objective facts about which everyone would agree.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Teaching skills are largely protected --&gt; Unit heads imply that teaching skills are largely protected</P>
<P>core activities are examined by managers --&gt; managers say they supervise core activities</P>
<P>Further, internal use of evaluation is quite low. --&gt; Further, the respondents perceive quite low internal use of evaluation.</P>
<P>less than half of the agencies make frequent use of --&gt; less than half of the interviewees reported frequent use of</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<U><P>Generalizations</U>: Do not draw conclusions about all organizations from observations of some organizations, or conclusions about all people (tasks, environments, roles, decisions) from data concerning some people (tasks, environments, roles, decisions). In particular, beware of over-generalizing inadvertently through inappropriate singular nouns. The following statement, for example,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The rational model asserts that the role of new structure is to maintain or increase task control and coordination, while the institutional model asserts that structure is added to indicate conformity to institutional pressures and has a minor internal role."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>might be interpreted to mean:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The only conceivable rational model asserts that all organizations always introduce new structures solely to maintain or increase task control and coordination, whereas the only conceivable institutional model asserts that all organizations always add new structures almost exclusively to indicate conformity to institutional pressures and all organizations always assign minor internal roles to new structures.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Would your reaction have been different if the authors of the foregoing statement had said the following instead?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>One rational model asserts that some new structures maintain or increase task control and coordination, whereas one institutional model asserts that some organizations sometimes add new structures mainly to indicate conformity to institutional pressures, and so these new structures may perform minor internal roles. Of course, some new structures may perform none of these roles, and other new structures may simultaneously maintain task control, increase coordination, perform other internal roles, and indicate conformity to institutional pressures. Other rational models may assert that rationality entails creating new structures in order to indicate conformity to institutional pressures, and other institutional models may assert that conforming to institutional pressures does not preclude benefits from internal effects.</P></DIR>

<H2>Distinguish between definite articles and indefinite articles.</H2>
<P>Many singular-plural problems arise because authors use definite articles (the) where they ought to use indefinite articles (a, an). In particular, authors frequently use definite articles with singular nouns where they should use plural nouns.</P>
<P>The definite article (the) denotes a specific, nameable instance. <I>The environment</I> means one specific environment, such as the British steel industry or Indianapolis; and <I>the organization</I> means one specific, nameable organization, such as Control Data or the University of Wyoming. An indefinite article (a, an) designates a typical, nonspecific instance. Thus, <I>an environment</I> means one typical environment, and <I>an organization</I> means one typical organization.</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P>Confusion of definite and indefinite articles causes serious substantive problems throughout the social sciences. For example, their penchant for saying <I>the organization</I> has allowed organization theorists to gloss over the differences between organizations and to speak as if all organizations act the same. Similarly, by saying <I>the environment</I>, organization theorists have understated the degrees to which environments are ambiguous, diverse, and selected. Indeed, organization theorists should normally speak of one organization facing multiple environments: Most organizations deal with diverse task environments because they perform multiple tasks, but even an organization that faces just one task environment would possess multiple potential environments and multiple nontask environments.</P>
<P>Note the misinterpretations that could arise from speaking of <I>the theory of the firm</I>, <I>the regulatory process</I>, or <I>the decision-making process</I>. The homogeneity of social phenomena ought to be established empirically rather than rhetorically.</P>

<P>Particularly, do not give a concept two names, one theoretical and the other operational. Too often, social scientists have reported and pompously interpreted as meaningful correlations between vague, global variables when, in fact, these correlations resulted from tautological or commonplace relationships between the actual measures.</P>
<H2>Use only one term per concept; avoid synonyms.</H2>
<P>What you may regard as interesting variety may cause your readers confusion or complete bewilderment. Once you have referred to <I>the clients</I>, for instance, continue to call them <I>the clients</I> and do not refer to them as <I>the beneficiaries </I>or <I>the program's participants</I>. Similarly, if you have designated someone as <I>the consultant</I>, maintain this label and do not substitute <I>the change agent</I>, <I>the intervener</I>, or <I>the facilitator</I>. Various authors used the following terms as synonyms:</P><DIR>

<P>goals = outcomes = interests behavior = actions</P>
<P>results = findings</P>

<P>Reference frames may also vary in content, with one organization's collective frame of reference best typified as "entrepreneurial," while that of another as "scientific" or "humanistic," as illustrated by the organizational studies conducted by Litterer and Young. --&gt; Reference frames may exhibit primarily entrepreneurial, scientific, or humanistic orientations (Litterer and Young). </P>

<P>But do make sure that the adjectives and possessives say what you intend! One author used the phrase "personal causal models" to denote "models in which persons cause events".</P>

<H2>Hyphenate related modifiers.</H2>
<P>Insert hyphens between the components of compound adjectives. A compound adjective is a pair of words - either an adjective and a noun or two nouns - that jointly act as a single adjective. Thus, you should hyphenate "environmental-resource variation" because environmental-resource is a compound adjective modifying variation. You should hyphenate "population-ecology model" because population-ecology is a compound adjective modifying model. Other examples would be:</P>

<P>But do not mislead your readers by hyphenating unrelated words, as did the authors who said "geographic-market location", "the managerial-role making process", and "management-organization-behavior-science discipline".</P>
<P>Although most journals and publishers make no distinction, high-quality publishers use two sizes of hyphens. Because they transform two or more words into one, the above examples call for narrow hyphens, the width of the character n. Wide hyphens, the width of the character m, link two words without converting them into a single term; for example, technology-structure relations, or organization-environment interactions. Wide hyphens often stand for <I>and</I> or <I>versus</I>.</P>

<P>Some of the most important causes of verbosity are: passive verbs, forms of the verb To Be, lead-in phrases, and phrases of the form article + noun + of.

<H2>Keep sentences short.</H2>
<P>Long sentences make reading difficult and they often indicate convoluted, muddy logic. Very few sentences should exceed 20 words, and long sentences should have very simple structures. Excessive length and unnecessary complexity make the following sentences hard to understand:</P><DIR>

<P>For instance, if a manager offers a type of help or has expectations about the degree of responsibility that should be given an employee which is in direct conflict with what the employee expects or desires, the outcome will not be satisfactory. --&gt; For instance, dissatisfaction would likely result if a supervisor and a subordinate have disparate expectations about the subordinate's responsibilities.</P>
<P>Duncan later developed scales for measurement of environmental dimensions of dynamism and complexity as well as perceived environmental uncertainty and showed that perceptions of uncertainty were related to perceptions of dynamism and complexity. --&gt; Duncan later showed that perceptions of environmental uncertainty correlate significantly with percept ions of environmental dynamism and complexity.</P>
<P>A key exception is found in Miles (1982) study of the cigarette industry's defense of its particular domain in light of the Surgeon General's report on the health hazards of smoking, and the TV and radio advertising ban, which well illustrates the domain defense objective of political activity. --&gt; However, political activities may defend domains, as Miles showed in his (1982) study of cigarette companies' reactions to the Surgeon General's report on smoking.</P>
<P>Indeed, one of the reasons why cultural variables have been neglected in the past is that they are less obtrusive in the way they channel behaviour and govern organizational performance than more explicit, external factors such as organizational structure, control and reward systems and high- level processes of decision- making. --&gt; Indeed, observers have neglected cultural variables partly because these channel behaviours more subtly than do organizational structures, control-and-reward systems, and high-level decisions.</P>
<P>Given the high level of aggregation of industry data from which the objective environmental measures are developed and the possibility that the perceptions of top management may be influenced by their personal characteristics as well as the capability of the information processing mechanisms of their organizations for monitoring and decoding environmental signals, it is interesting that a number of meaningful direct relationships are found. --&gt; Meaningful correlations appear even though the environmental measures use very aggregated data and even though the top managers' perceptions reflect their personal characteristics and their organizations' environmental scanning.</P></DIR>

<H2>Measure the reading level and continue editing until reading is easy.</H2>
<P>Your goal as a writer should be to explain your ideas clearly, not to impress readers with your erudition or to demonstrate the complexity of your thinking. When journal editors criticize the ideas in a manuscript, they have very often misunderstood what the authors intended to say. Although almost all of your intended readers have doctorates, you should not assume that they understand complex language. Everyone gets much more experience reading simple language than complex language, so they read simpler language more quickly and with greater comprehension.</P>
<P>Word processors are capable of measuring the readability of text, and you should take advantage of this capability. Reports of social science-research can rarely be as readable as a newspaper or magazine, but it is possible to bring the reading level of social-science research down to a 12th-grade level. You should spend the time and effort to do that. To make text more readable, you mainly need (a) to substitute shorter words for longer ones and (b) break long sentences into shorter ones. The grammar checker in your word processor will identify long sentences for you. To identify long words, is more difficult, but you can do the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(a) make a copy of your document,</P>
<P>(b) eliminate punctuation, apostrophes, hyphens, and double spaces,</P>
<P>(c) replace spaces with carriage returns,</P>
<P>(d) copy the entire document and paste it into a spreadsheet,</P>
<P>(e) compute the length of each word,</P>
<P>(f) sort the words to bring the longest words to the top.</P></DIR>

<H2>Do not split infinitives.</H2>
<P>An infinitive bonds the word <I>to</I> to a verb stem; for example </P>

<P>The basic rule is that an infinitive acts like a single word. Because <I>to face</I> is all one word, <I>to collectively face</I> injects the word <I>collectively</I> into the middle of another word, splitting the infinitive. Here are a few other split infinitives:</P>

</DIR>

<P>Also, when you create a string of phrases each of which begins with an infinitive, you should repeat the <I>to</I> for each infinitive. For example,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</DIR>

<P>The <I>Oxford</I> and <I>Merriam Webster</I> dictionaries recently began saying that it is not grammatically incorrect to split infinitives. If you choose to split an infinitive, do so only in simple cases involving only verbs and adverbs. For instance, it seems reasonable to say "to publicly acknowledge" or "to publicly acknowledge and successfully support" because the meaning is quite clear. The meaning becomes much less clear when adjectives and nouns become involved, as in "the political desire to control public spending and reduce the scale of government."</P>
<H2>Do not dangle modifying phrases.</H2>
<P>Make sure that modifying phrases actually modify the words you intend. A modifying phrase that introduces a clause should modify either the subject of the clause or the verb.</P><DIR>

<H2>Clauses should not end with prepositions.</H2>
<P>What were you thinking of? Didn't Miss Stansbury teach you not to use a preposition to end a sentence with?</P>
<H2>Check the references.</H2>
<P>Make sure that works cited in the text appear in the reference list, and vice versa.</P>
<P>Verify dates as well as names.</P>
<P>Never risk your credibility by citing works you have not seen.</P>
<H2>Only use words that appear in some English-language dictionary.</H2>
<P>Do not make up words such as "and/or", "operationalize", or "input" used as a verb.</P>
<H2>Authors quite often misuse the following words -</H2>
<U><P>Which</U> - <U>That</U> - <U>Who</P>
</U><P>Usually you should say <I>that</I> instead of <I>which</I>, unless <I>which</I> (a) serves as the object of a preposition, (b) follows a comma, or (c) indicates a question. Specifically, you should use <I>that</I> to initiate a <I>restrictive</I> clause - one that limits the meaning of the noun it modifies. For example, the following illustrate restrictive clauses:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>characteristics which inhibit/facilitate --&gt; characteristics that inhibit or facilitate</P>
<P>processes which link --&gt; processes that link</P>
<P>organizations which do not exhibit --&gt; organizations that lack</P>

<P>The reconceptualization of X which flows from --&gt; The reconceptualization of X that flows from</P>
<P>environments which will turn --&gt; environments that will turn</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Conversely, you should use <I>which</I> to initiate a <I>nonrestrictive</I> clause and you should set a nonrestrictive clause off with commas. For example, the following illustrate nonrestrictive clauses:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>innate characteristics, which all people have, </P>
<P>production processes, which link inputs to outputs, </P>
<P>organizations, which have structures, </P>
<P>advantages, which bring benefits, </P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>First-person pronouns do sometimes serve well, but you should recognize the disadvantages of saying <I>I</I>, <I>we</I>, <I>our</I> or <I>you</I>. When you refer explicitly to yourself, you remind your readers that they are reading your ideas, not their ideas; and consequently you make it more difficult for your readers to adopt your ideas as their own.

<H2>Avoid the past and future tenses, use the present tense.</H2>
<P>The present tense keeps readers more involved than do the past or future tenses. But do use past tenses when attributing quotations or ideas to people; Max Weber may no longer be saying what he once said.</P>

</DIR>

</FONT><P>Ed Ames regarded this law as a way to hold readers' interest, and he was right. Passive verbs, To Be verbs, and nouns make boring reading and they also produce verbose phrasings.</P>
<P>But more importantly, passive verbs and nouns seem to encourage social scientists to view themselves as passive observers, to see other people as puppets of impersonal forces, and to build static theories. Using static words to describe reality leads scientists to create static frames of reference, to view social worlds as stable, and thus to overlook dynamic events. Using active verbs and adverbs, on the other hand, subtly encourages scientists to notice changes and reactions and histories, and to see themselves as actual and potential actors.</P>
<P>The basic rule for converting to active phrasings is: identify the source of action and make this actor the subject of the sentence. To do this, you have to analyze causality, with the result that you may have to explicate processes that you had previously left implicit. Not only does this make your theories clearer, it also makes them more dynamic.</P>
<H2>Eliminate passive verbs.</H2>
<P>You can often convert passive verbs merely by substituting active verbs.</P><DIR>
